## Recent Major Achievements
- **Asset Snapshot Deletion Logic Fix** (September 23, 2025)
  - **Root Cause Analysis**: Identified that backend was using soft delete (set `isActive: false`) but not filtering by `isActive: true` by default
  - **Frontend Issue**: Frontend was not sending `isActive: true` parameter, so backend returned both active and inactive snapshots
  - **Backend Fix**: Modified `SnapshotRepository.createQueryBuilder()` to default filter by `isActive: true` when parameter not provided

    - ✅ **Default Active Filter**: Backend now defaults to `isActive: true` when parameter not provided
    - ✅ **Soft Delete Support**: Maintains soft delete functionality while ensuring proper filtering
    - ✅ **Backward Compatibility**: Explicit `isActive` parameter still works for admin/debug purposes
    - ✅ **Performance**: No performance impact, same query efficiency
    - ✅ **Data Integrity**: Deleted snapshots remain in database for audit purposes
