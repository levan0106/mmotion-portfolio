# Asset Management Improvements - Product Requirements Document

## Document Information
**Document Type**: Product Requirements Document (PRD)  
**CR Number**: CR-003  
**Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: September 15, 2025  
**Author**: System Architect  
**Status**: Ready for Review  

## Executive Summary
This PRD outlines comprehensive improvements to the Asset Management module to address data consistency issues, enhance user experience, and improve system reliability. The improvements include standardizing on symbol field, allowing flexible asset naming, implementing read-only symbol constraints, and enhancing asset deletion workflow.

## Background
The current Asset Management system has several limitations that impact user experience and data consistency:

1. **Data Inconsistency**: Frontend uses `symbol` field while backend uses `code` field, causing mapping issues
2. **Rigid Naming**: Asset names must be globally unique, limiting real-world use cases
3. **Data Integrity**: Symbol field can be modified after creation, causing trade history inconsistencies
4. **Poor Deletion UX**: Asset deletion is blocked without clear information about consequences

## Business Objectives
- **Improve Data Consistency**: Standardize on single field for asset identification across frontend and backend
- **Enhance User Experience**: Provide flexible asset naming and clear deletion warnings
- **Maintain Data Integrity**: Prevent accidental symbol changes that break trade history
- **Increase System Reliability**: Ensure consistent data across all system components

## Success Metrics
- **Data Consistency**: 100% of assets use `symbol` field consistently
- **User Satisfaction**: Reduced confusion in asset management workflows
- **Data Integrity**: Zero trade history inconsistencies due to symbol changes
- **System Reliability**: All asset operations work seamlessly across frontend/backend

## Functional Requirements

### FR1: Symbol Field Standardization
**Priority**: High  
**Description**: Standardize the entire system to use `symbol` field for asset identification

#### User Stories
- **As a developer**, I want consistent field naming between frontend and backend so that data mapping works correctly
- **As a user**, I want asset data to be consistent across all interfaces so that I don't see different information in different places

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All existing data migrated from `code` to `symbol` field
- [ ] `code` field completely removed from database and codebase
- [ ] All API endpoints use `symbol` field consistently
- [ ] Frontend uses `symbol` field for all asset operations
- [ ] Data migration can be rolled back if needed

### FR2: Flexible Asset Naming
**Priority**: High  
**Description**: Allow duplicate asset names with unique symbols per user

#### User Stories
- **As a user**, I want to create multiple assets with the same name so that I can track different portfolios
- **As a user**, I want to create assets with common names like "Apple Inc." without conflicts with other users
- **As a user**, I want my asset symbols to be unique within my account so that I can distinguish between assets

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Multiple users can have assets with the same name
- [ ] Same user can have multiple assets with the same name (different symbols)
- [ ] Symbol uniqueness enforced per user only
- [ ] Validation error messages updated to reflect new rules
- [ ] Search and filtering work correctly with new naming rules

### FR3: Read-Only Symbol Field
**Priority**: Medium  
**Description**: Make symbol field read-only after asset creation

#### User Stories
- **As a user**, I want to prevent accidental symbol changes so that my trade history remains consistent
- **As a developer**, I want symbol field to be immutable after creation so that data integrity is maintained

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Symbol field removed from `UpdateAssetDto`
- [ ] Update API returns clear error if symbol is provided
- [ ] Frontend shows symbol as read-only in asset details
- [ ] Frontend update forms don't include symbol field
- [ ] Clear error messages for symbol update attempts

### FR4: Enhanced Asset Deletion
**Priority**: High  
**Description**: Provide clear warning and confirmation for asset deletion with associated trades

#### User Stories
- **As a user**, I want to see how many trades are linked to an asset before deleting it
- **As a user**, I want to choose whether to delete an asset and its trades or cancel the operation
- **As a user**, I want clear information about what will be deleted so that I can make informed decisions

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Delete request shows trade count warning instead of blocking
- [ ] User can choose to proceed with deletion or cancel
- [ ] Force deletion removes all associated trades then deletes asset
- [ ] Clear confirmation dialog shows trade count and consequences
- [ ] Deletion summary shows what was removed

## Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR1: Data Migration Safety
- **Requirement**: Data migration must be reversible
- **Criteria**: Full database backup before migration, rollback procedure documented
- **Priority**: High

### NFR2: System Availability
- **Requirement**: System downtime during migration should be minimal
- **Criteria**: Migration completed within 2-hour maintenance window
- **Priority**: High

### NFR3: Performance
- **Requirement**: No performance degradation after changes
- **Criteria**: All asset operations maintain current response times
- **Priority**: Medium

### NFR4: Backward Compatibility
- **Requirement**: Existing API consumers should be notified of changes
- **Criteria**: API versioning and migration guide provided
- **Priority**: Medium

## User Experience Requirements

### UX1: Clear Error Messages
- **Requirement**: All error messages should be clear and actionable
- **Example**: "Symbol cannot be updated after asset creation" instead of generic error

### UX2: Intuitive Deletion Flow
- **Requirement**: Asset deletion should provide clear information and options
- **Example**: Show trade count and offer "Delete Asset & Trades" or "Cancel" options

### UX3: Consistent Field Usage
- **Requirement**: Symbol field should be used consistently across all interfaces
- **Example**: Asset list, forms, and details all show symbol field

## Technical Constraints

### TC1: Database Migration
- **Constraint**: Must migrate existing data without data loss
- **Impact**: Requires careful migration script and testing

### TC2: API Compatibility
- **Constraint**: Must maintain API compatibility during transition
- **Impact**: May require API versioning

### TC3: Frontend Updates
- **Constraint**: Frontend must be updated to use symbol field consistently
- **Impact**: Requires frontend component updates

## Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies
- Database backup and restore procedures
- System maintenance window
- Frontend component updates
- Backend service updates

### External Dependencies
- None identified

## Assumptions

### A1: Data Migration
- **Assumption**: Existing data can be safely migrated from `code` to `symbol` field
- **Risk**: Data loss if migration fails
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive testing and backup procedures

### A2: User Acceptance
- **Assumption**: Users will accept the new naming flexibility
- **Risk**: User confusion with new rules
- **Mitigation**: Clear documentation and user training

## Risks and Mitigation

### High Risk
- **Data Loss During Migration**
  - **Risk**: Migration could corrupt or lose data
  - **Mitigation**: Full database backup, comprehensive testing, rollback plan

### Medium Risk
- **System Downtime**
  - **Risk**: Migration could cause extended downtime
  - **Mitigation**: Maintenance window, efficient migration script

### Low Risk
- **User Confusion**
  - **Risk**: Users might be confused by new naming rules
  - **Mitigation**: Clear documentation, user training

## Success Criteria

### Primary Success Criteria
- [ ] All 4 functional requirements implemented successfully
- [ ] Zero data loss during migration
- [ ] All existing functionality preserved
- [ ] System performance maintained

### Secondary Success Criteria
- [ ] User satisfaction improved
