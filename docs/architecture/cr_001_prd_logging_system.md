## Executive Summary

This document outlines the requirements for implementing a comprehensive logging system for the Portfolio Management System backend services. The logging system will provide structured error tracking, performance monitoring, and audit trails to help developers quickly understand and fix bugs, monitor system health, and maintain compliance.

## Business Context

### Problem Statement
Currently, the Portfolio Management System lacks comprehensive logging capabilities, making it difficult to:
- Debug production issues quickly
- Monitor system performance and health
- Track user actions for audit purposes
- Identify security threats or suspicious activities
- Analyze system behavior patterns

### Business Value
- **Faster Bug Resolution**: Structured error logs with context enable quick issue identification
- **Improved System Reliability**: Proactive monitoring helps prevent system failures
- **Compliance Support**: Audit trails support financial compliance requirements
- **Performance Optimization**: Detailed performance logs enable system optimization
- **Security Monitoring**: Comprehensive logging helps detect and respond to security threats

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Logs are stored in structured format (JSON)
- Logs are searchable by multiple criteria (timestamp, user, error type)
- Log retention policies are configurable
- Logs can be exported for analysis
- Real-time log streaming is supported

## Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR-001: Performance
- Logging should not impact application performance by more than 5%

- Logs should not be lost during system failures
- Logging failures should not crash the application

### NFR-003: Security
- Logs should be encrypted at rest
- Access to logs should be role-based
- Sensitive data should be masked or excluded

### NFR-004: Scalability
- Logging system should handle increasing log volume
- Log storage should be horizontally scalable
- Log processing should support parallel operations

### NFR-005: Compliance
- Logs should support audit requirements
- Log retention should meet regulatory requirements
- Log integrity should be verifiable

## User Stories

- Alerts are generated for critical issues

### US-003: Security Analyst Investigation
**As a** security analyst
**I want to** track security events and suspicious activities
**So that** I can detect and respond to security threats

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Security events are clearly identified
- Suspicious patterns are flagged
- Audit trails are complete and tamper-proof

### US-004: Business Analyst Reporting
**As a** business analyst
**I want to** analyze user behavior and system usage
